## Introduction
This repository contains my weekly practice exercises and personal reflections from the CP1404 course. Through these practices, I gradually mastered the basic concepts of programming and accumulated valuable experience, laying the foundation for future projects. Through continuous practice and reflection, I have not only improved my coding skills, but also deepened my understanding of programming patterns and code quality.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
As the course progresses, my understanding of 'clean code' continues to deepen, gradually forming some unique insights on how to write high-quality code:

- **Special naming convention:** For numerical values with specific meanings, conventional names such as "max" or "min" are no longer used, but more expressive names such as "limit" are used to represent unique limit values. This naming convention not only makes the code more semantic, but also makes it easier for others to quickly understand the functionality and limitations of the code.
- **Clear comments:** Each piece of code should include clear and directional comments, detailing its purpose, implementation logic, and possible considerations. Such comments can help others quickly grasp the code intent, especially when the code is complex. Even simple code snippets, comments can provide additional context for easy maintenance in the future.
- **Code refactoring and deduplication:** Avoiding duplicate code is key to improving code efficiency and maintainability. By refactoring, similar logic can be extracted into separate functions or modules, making the code simpler, easier to extend, and reducing the likelihood of errors occurring. The refactored code is not only more organized, but also improves the running efficiency and overall quality of the code.
