# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

In the process of studying this course, I gradually realized the importance of code optimization and constant naming. At first, although my code could run normally, it often lacked efficiency and clarity. Through the exercises in the course and the guidance of the teacher, I gradually learned how to optimize the code structure to make it more concise and efficient. At the same time, I also realized that using standardized constant names can improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the intent of the code.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

In terms of methodology, I still need to practice coding more, further familiarize myself with various programming techniques and implementation methods, in order to apply the knowledge learned more flexibly in tasks. At the same time, I also need to plan my study time reasonably and not always procrastinate until the end to complete assignments. It is best to set a small goal every week. And I need to maintain a positive learning attitude and actively seek solutions when facing difficulties.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Proactively seeking help: When encountering unfamiliar problems, I will promptly seek advice from classmates to ensure that I can quickly understand and master new knowledge points.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

During the learning process, I realized that I cannot rely too much on the code examples provided by the teacher. Although these codes provide us with good references, we cannot truly grasp the knowledge if we rely solely on them. Therefore, I need to spend more time independently thinking and trying different implementation methods based on understanding the example code.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

For me, the course can provide more opportunities for practice and hands-on experience to help me consolidate my knowledge and enhance my programming skills.
