## 6. What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
### Clear code:

I want to design clear and maintainable code. Ensure that each function and module is responsible for only one task, making it easy to understand, test, and extend.


### Write comments and documents:

I will add simple comments in the code to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.


### Maintain learning and practice:

Write more code and practice more in your free time, constantly improving yourself.
